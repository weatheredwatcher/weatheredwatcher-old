<h3>About Me</h3>
        <!-- main -->
           <div id="main">
			<p>I was born in Greensboro NC. When I was 12, my parents moved the entire family to Kazakhstan 
				where I became very active in the hacker community. Me and my friend Kostya Tayban started 
				running BBS's from our homes and were for a time connected to the FidoNet.</p>

			<p>My wife and I came to the states in 2000 and in 2001 moved to Charlotte NC. In Charlotte 
				I did IT work for several Car Dealerships as well as some web and software development 
				for a few small start-up ventures.</p>

			<p>In 2006, moved the family to Columbia SC were I begain working for the Institute of 
				Strategic Languages and Cultures as a web-developer.</p>

			<p>I work in PHP, Ruby on Rails, Ajax/JavaScript, Python and Clojure. I develop on Linux (Fedora).</p>

			<p>Over the years, I have worked for several start ups, including Lead Programmer for 
				Leveraged Media, a Tech Company disguised as a Marketing Company disguised as a 
				Tech company and most recently for Political Exchange, a Political Social Media Outlet.</p>

			<p>I am currently freelancing as a Consultant here in Columbia, SC. I focus on building 
				software infrastructures for start-ups, using FOSS in Health Care and teaching and 
				training on FOSS.</p>

			<p>I also do some dabbling in social media integration.</p>
			
			<p> In 1999 I was first introduced to Linux.  A family friend gave me a install disk for Red Hat. In order to get it to work on the
			desktop that I had laying around (some PI or PII that I had helped my Grandfather build earlier) I had to write my own config
			file for X.  Ahh! I was in love.  Over the years I have tried pretty much every single Linux Distro in existence.  I tried Debian,
			Sabayon has a pretty take on Gentoo, and
			SuSE has it's charms but I have come back at the end to Fedora.</p>
