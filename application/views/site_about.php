			<p>I was born in Greensboro NC. When I was 12, my parents moved the entire family to Kazakhstan 
				whereI became very active in the hacker community. Me and my friend Kostya Tayban started 
				running BBS's from our homes and were for a time connected to the FidoNet.</p>

			<p>My wife and I came to the states in 2000 and in 2001 moved to Charlotte NC. In Charlotte 
				I did IT work for several Car Dealerships as well as some web and software development 
				for a few small start-up ventures.</p>

				Strategic Languages and Cultures as a web-developer.</p>
