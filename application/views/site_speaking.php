			<h3>Speaking</h3>

			<p>I am available to speak at conferences and other events. Why would you want me to speak? I have over ten years experience in the Open Source world.  I am an active developer in the open source community and I believe in using open software to develop open standards.</p>

			<h3>POSSCON</h3>

			<p> In 2011 I was a speaker at POSSCON here in Columbia SC.  I gave a talk on using Open Source Software to Run you business.  I also gave a workshop on using various Open Source Software programs.</p>

      <p> In 2012 I co-hosted a php "Birds of a Feather" luncheon with the fabulous Elizabeth Naramore. I discussed  the creation of a Columbia based PHP Users Group and demoed the new server feature in php 5.4.0  </p>

<h3>North East PHP Conference</h3>
<p> In 2012 I was privileged to speak at the first Northeastern PHP Conference in Boston MA.  It was a great time packed full
    of a lot of great speakers!  I gave a talk on coding a blog in CodeIgniter.  I am linking to the source as well as the slides
