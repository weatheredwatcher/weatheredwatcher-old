When I was 12, my parents moved the entire family to Kazakhstan \n\t\t\t\twhere I became very active in the hacker community. Me and my friend Kostya Tayban started \n\t\t\t\trunning BBS's from our homes and were for a time connected to the FidoNet.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>I came to the states in 2000 and in 2001 moved to Charlotte NC. In Charlotte \n\t\t\t\tI did IT work for several Car Dealerships as well as some web and software development \n\t\t\t\tfor a few small start-up ventures.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>In 2006, moved to Columbia SC were I begain working for the Institute of \n\t\t\t\tStrategic Languages and Cultures as a web-developer.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>I work in PHP, Ruby on Rails, Ajax/JavaScript, Python and Clojure. I develop on Linux (Fedora).</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>Over the years, I have worked for several start ups, including Lead Programmer for \n\t\t\t\tLeveraged Media, a Tech Company disguised as a Marketing Company disguised as a \n\t\t\t\tTech company and most recently for Political Exchange, a Political Social Media Outlet.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>I am currently freelancing as a Consultant here in Columbia, SC. I focus on building \n\t\t\t\tsoftware infrastructures for start-ups, using FOSS in Health Care and teaching and \n\t\t\t\ttraining on FOSS.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>I also do some dabbling in social media integration.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p> In 1999 I was first introduced to Linux.  A family friend gave me a install disk for Red Hat. In order to get it to work on the\n\t\t\tdesktop that I had laying around (some PI or PII that I had helped my Grandfather build earlier) I had to write my own config\n\t\t\tfile for X.  Ahh! I was in love.  Over the years I have tried pretty much every single Linux Distro in existence.  I tried Debian,\n\t\t\tSabayon has a pretty take on Gentoo, and\n\t\t\tSuSE has it's charms but I have come back at the end to Fedora.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n        <!-- /main -->\n                </div>\n\t\t\t\t <!-- sidebar -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t     <?= $this->load->view('_sidebar');?>           \n\t\t\t     <!-- /sidebar -->\n\n    <!-- content -->\n        </div>\n\n<!-- /content-out -->\n</div>\n<?= $this->load->view('_footer');?>"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":2282}]],"length":2282}
