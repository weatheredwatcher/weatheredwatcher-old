The segments in a\n| URL normally follow this pattern:\n|\n|\texample.com/class/method/id/\n|\n| In some instances, however, you may want to remap this relationship\n| so that a different class/function is called than the one\n| corresponding to the URL.\n|\n| Please see the user guide for complete details:\n|\n|\thttp://codeigniter.com/user_guide/general/routing.html\n|\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n| RESERVED ROUTES\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n|\n| There are two reserved routes:\n|\n|\t$route['default_controller'] = 'welcome';\n|\n| This route indicates which controller class should be loaded if the\n| URI contains no data. In the above example, the \"welcome\" class\n| would be loaded.\n|\n|\t$route['404_override'] = 'errors/page_missing';\n|\n| This route will tell the Router what URI segments to use if those provided\n| in the URL cannot be matched to a valid route.\n|\n*/\n\n$route['default_controller'] = \"site\";\n//these routes help keep the url's clean\n$route['about'] = \"site/about\";\n$route['projects'] = \"site/projects\";\n$route['speaking'] = \"site/speaking\";\n$route['blog/:num'] = \"blog\";\n\n//custom 404_override\n$route['404_override'] = '';\n\n\n/* End of file routes.php */\n/* Location: ./application/config/routes.php */"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":2680}]],"length":2680}
